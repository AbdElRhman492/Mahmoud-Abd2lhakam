# Mahmoud Abd2lhakam's Website

---

**Hello**, I learned **Front End** a while ago, <br />
and I was practicing with myself, but when I saw **Mahmoud's design**, <br />
![The Design](296218329_414923013999315_8347376955265921622_n.png)
I liked it very much. Then we communicated with each other and it was agreed to work on his site as a **training method**. <br />
I made some modifications to make it suitable and <br />
responsive to all different sizes of screens, <br />
and the work was completed. In no more than **15 hours**, <br />
I hope you like it
